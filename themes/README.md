# Themes

A theme is a folder with a `config.json` and, optionally, a `wallpaper.jpg`. Pushing one changes the
launcher's dock, layout and look on the TV without rebuilding the APK: the launcher reads
`config.json` as an overlay over its built-in `config.xml` the next time it starts.

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh themes/aurora          # push a theme and restart Home
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh --reset                # back to the built-in config.xml
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\theme.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50 themes\aurora
```

| Theme | What it does |
|---|---|
| `default/` | The built-in look written out as JSON, as a starting point for your own |
| `aurora/` | A dark aurora wallpaper (teal and violet on navy, darker at the bottom) with a matching background colour |
| `six-columns/` | Six smaller tiles per row and one grid row visible under the dock |

## Keys

Every key is optional; a missing key keeps the value from `config.xml`, an unknown or wrongly typed key
is ignored, and a file that doesn't parse is ignored as a whole, so a theme can never break Home.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `dock_apps` | list of package names | Apps pinned first, in order (the dock row, or the first grid tiles with `dock_row` off); any number; the rest follow alphabetically; missing apps are skipped |
| `hidden_apps` | list of package names | Never shown as tiles |
| `live_tv_package`, `live_tv_action` | string | The Live TV app and, if it has no leanback entry, the action to start it with |
| `source_panel_service`, `source_panel_action` | string | The TV's own source panel, for sets with no TvInputManager |
| `input_action` | string | Action sent with an HDMI/AV row's channel URI when nothing handles the standard `VIEW` (XGIMI: `com.xgimi.action.hdmiPlayer`) |
| `columns` | 1 to 8 | Tiles per row; tiles shrink to fit from 5 up |
| `rows_below_dock` | 0 to 3 | Grid rows left visible under the dock; tiles shrink if the dock and that many rows would not fit the screen height |
| `dock_row` | bool | The dock as its own row with a band (`true`); `false` makes the dock apps the first tiles of one plain grid |
| `dock_title` | bool | The focused dock app's name in large type above the dock (`true`); `false` keeps only the glow |
| `shamsi_date` | bool | Show the Solar Hijri date above the Gregorian one |
| `module_cards` | bool | Look for module cards and ask about them (`true`); `false` turns the feature off |
| `reduced_motion` | bool | Snappy, minimal motion for weak GPUs: critically damped highlight, short zoom, no fades, no tile entrance |
| `vpn_app` | string | App the network pill opens when a VPN is configured; also shows a red "VPN off" badge while no VPN is up |
| `show_home_settings_shortcut` | bool | The "Default home" tile, where the TV has a home picker |
| `background_color` | `#RRGGBB` | Colour behind everything; black by default |
| `wallpaper` | bool | Show `wallpaper.jpg` from the theme folder (`true`), or ignore it (`false`) |

## Wallpapers

`wallpaper.jpg` is drawn full screen behind the launcher, centre-cropped. Keep it dark, 1920×1080 and
under about 300 KB: the text, the hero name and the dock band are designed for black, and a 1 GB TV
decodes the picture into memory on every Home start. Pictures larger than the screen are downsampled.

## Reorder on the TV

The two-arrow button in the top bar turns reorder mode on (blue outline). Move to an app and press OK to pick it
up, move it with the arrows (Left and Right wrap across rows), and press Back to put it down; repeat for other apps,
then press Back once more to finish and save. Apps don't open while the mode is on. The order is kept in the launcher's private files and
wins over `dock_apps` until `dock_apps` itself changes (a rebuild or a pushed theme), which starts over from the
new list. New apps join at the end.

## Reduced motion

`"reduced_motion": true` keeps the look but makes the movement snappy and minimal: the highlight
spring is very stiff and critically damped (no bounce), tiles zoom briefly without overshoot, names, the
top shelf and the glow switch instantly instead of fading, and tiles have no entrance animation. Use it on TVs whose GPU cannot keep up; a MediaTek MT5895 on
Android 10 is the known case. The default, `false`, keeps the normal motion.

```json
{ "reduced_motion": true }
```

## Adding a theme

Open a PR with a new folder here, a one-line row in the table above and a screenshot from a real TV
in the PR description. Keep the dock list generic (the big streaming apps) unless the theme is for a
specific TV, and say which TV you tried it on.
